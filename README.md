The following is a detailed description of each naming code
kNDVI: Construct the kNDVI dataset in the GEE platform;
Sen: Calculate the trend of kNDVI using Theil-Sen trend analysis;
MK: Calculate the significance of kNDVI trend using Mann-Kendall test;
LagAcc and LagAcc_Period: Calculate the lag and accumulation period of kndvi to each climate factor.
residual1-3: Calculate the contribution rate of each scenario.

It should be noted that except for “kNDVI”, which is JavaScript code applicable to GEE, the rest of the code is based on the matlab environment.
